Here we are, I built myself a personal website and this is my first post. I write it mainly as a way
to test my build system and Markdown compiler. It might also be my last post considering I can, at
the moment, not think of any topic I would discuss here. I am by no means a good writer and that is
also not what I try to accomplish with this post. What I will do in this post, is describe how the
website is build. I will also test out some Markdown elements supported by the Markdown compiler.

First, it is important to mention, that this site uses no runtime JavaScript. It is, however,
statically generated using JavaScript code. While there already exist a lot of site generators, I
decided to start from scratch, only using [terser][terser] and [highlight.js][hljs] as build-time
dependencies. All the code for building the HTML and CSS code and also the code for compiling the
Markdown documents to HTML have been written by me for this website.

At the most fundamental level, I have a Node.js script that when executed will write all the files
required for the website into a directory. Some of these files, in particular fonts, videos and
images, will simply be copied over from another directory. The HTML-files, however, will be
generated by the executed JavaScript and minimized using terser. Markdown documents will also be
compiled to HTML and wrapped in a small HTML template.  Some information like the post and project
information is loaded from JSON files to allow for easier changes. Given everything is written in
JavaScript the generator is rather slow, but it is fast enough for my small site.

One thing that is important for my generator, is the ability to display code. I am a programmer and
almost all of my posts will most likely be about programming, so naturally, I need a good way to
present code.  Therefore, my Markdown converter includes the feature to add code blocks with syntax
highlighting and line numbers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
[This is a C program]

```smalltalk
Smalltalk tools messageList
	browse: ChangeSet current changedMessageList
	title: 'Current Change Set'
```
[This is some Smalltalk code]

Here is an example from a part of this websites code:

```javascript
import { html, css, readJsonFile } from '../../build/build-util.js';

import { htmlTemplate } from '../html-template.js';
import { background, backgroundStyles } from '../background.js';

function experienceElement(info, lang) {
    return html`...`;
}

export function homeView(lang = 'en', url = '/') {
    return htmlTemplate('Roland Bernard - Home', html`
        <main>
           ${background(0, html`
                ...
            `)}
            <div id="experience">
                ${background(1, html`
                    ...
                    ${readJsonFile('src/page/info/education.json').map(
                        el => experienceElement(el, lang)
                    )}
                    ...
                    ${readJsonFile('src/page/info/other.json').map(
                        el => experienceElement(el, lang)
                    )}
                    ...
                `)}
            </div>
        </main>
    `, css`
        ${backgroundStyles()}
        ...
    `, lang, url);
}
```

In this example the `homeView` function will be called by the builder with different `lang` and
`url` arguments.  The result will be a string containing the HTML code which will then be written to
a certain file.  The functions `html`and `css` are not doing anything special and are manly used to
get syntax highlighting in text editors.  If you would like to know more about how the website is
implemented, you can look at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rolandbernard/rolandbernard.github.io).

Some other thing my Markdown converter supports are tables, images and footnotes[^1].
Here are some small examples to show how those might look:

 Country | Capital | Area
---------|---------|------------
Italy    | Rome    | 302,073 km²
Austria  | Vienna  | 83,879 km²
Switzerland | Bern | 41,285 km²
Germany  | Berlin  | 357,022 km²
[^This is a table]

![The Mandelbrot set](/projimg/mandelbrot.jpeg=250x "The Mandelbrot set")
[^This is a section of the Mandelbrot set]

That is all I have to show for today, I am looking forward to writing an actual post, but that might take a while.

Until then, have a nice day!
